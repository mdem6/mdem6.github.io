    <h1>Response Paper on Theft of Wages and Not Paying the Minimum Wage</h1>
    <p>Wage theft is a disturbing problem, especially when people in the US don't pay the minimum wage. This piece is mostly about this problem. The story goes into great depth about how bad this problem is in the ten states with the most people. It shows that about 2.4 million workers lose over $8 billion a year because their companies don't follow minimum wage rules. This response paper talks about how I felt about these results, the ethical issues with the data used, the effects of these practices, and how they might have affected society.</p>

    <h2>Ethics Things to Think About</h2>
    <p>The article's use of data from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group, which was probably gathered in an honest way, gives us a solid basis for figuring out how widespread pay theft is. Collecting data in an ethical way and making it anonymous ensures trustworthiness and privacy for users. However, the piece also brings up important moral concerns about companies who consistently underpay their workers. It asks what businesses should do to protect their workers and society as a whole.</p>

    <h2>A Look at the Data</h2>
    <p>The article's numbers are stark and make you want to read more. The claim that 17% of low-wage workers in the states that were looked at have had their wages violated paints a bleak picture of the job market for people who are already struggling. The fact that pay theft costs each worker an average of $3,300 a year shows both how much it hurts individuals and the economy as a whole. The data successfully supports the article's claim that pay theft is not just a few isolated cases but a common problem with the system that needs lawmakers' immediate attention.</p>

    <h2>What it means and what it does</h2>
    <p>Theft of wages affects workers and the business in many ways. In terms of the economy, it makes it harder for millions of people to make money and pushes a lot of families below the poverty line, where they have to rely more on government aid programs and cost taxpayers more money. On a social level, it hurts trust in the workplace and the rules set by labor laws. As a possible answer, the piece recommends making laws stronger and making sure they are followed. These steps are very important because they not only help stop future violations, but they also make managers less likely to act in an inappropriate way.</p>

    <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I knew about salary theft in a general way before reading the piece, but I didn't know how big of a problem it was or how it affected the whole system. The in-depth research and large amounts of data have greatly increased my knowledge and made me more worried about those who are affected. It has made me even more sure that strong labor rules and good ways to implement them are needed to protect workers, especially the weakest ones.</p>

    <p>The article's ideas about wage theft through breaking the minimum wage have been both interesting and upsetting. When it comes out that these kinds of practices are not only common but also very bad, everyone concerned needs to move quickly and strongly. It is very important that this problem gets the attention it needs, which should include not only scholarly talk but also government and community action to protect workers' rights and ways of making a living across the country.</p>
